### The URL entered does not appear to be a valid RSS/Atom feed

Fix from @developer0725

> Many users meet invalid URL message in popup window.
> Because some of feed engines don't accept custom user-agent such as "FeedNotifier/2.6 +http://www.feednotifier.com/".
> They don't send valid xml as response for feed url.
> A solution is that I change user-agent to browser's user-agent.
> I used user-agent for Chrome.
